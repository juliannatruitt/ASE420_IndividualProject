## Design:
* Program uses design patterns factory, strategy, and singleton.
* Commands report and query invoke a GUI popupbox to display tables/rows in a visually pleasing way.
* Popupbox is implemented using Tkinter and it uses a treeview to display tables/columns in a table.
* Users use the CMD to invoke commands.
* Validation checks on users inputs to ensure that data is being entered correctly.
* Excpetions (ValueError) are used for incorrect inputs.
* Classes follow SRP
