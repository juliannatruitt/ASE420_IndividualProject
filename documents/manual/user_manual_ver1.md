### Version 1 User Manual
## Rules that apply to all commands:
* Use the CMD to enter in all the different commands.
* When entering in a date, use the format yyyy/mm/dd, otherwise you will be displayed with an error to put the date in the right format
* When entering in a desciption for the record, or querying a keyword, use single quotes (') and not double quotes (").
* Once you locate the folder that the program is located in, make sure to run "python main.py" before you enter query, record, priority, or report.
* NOTE: when i give examples of what different commands look like, I enclose them in quotation marks (""), you should not include those quotation marks when you are entering in your command on the CMD.
## Query:
* A query should be of length 2. Ex) query :STUDY or query 2023/11/21 or query 'java'
* When querying a tag, you need to make sure you add a colon (:) before the tag. You must write tag in all uppercase.
* You can query the date today by either typing in 'query today' or 'query todays_Date'.
## Record:
* A record should be at least a length of 5.
* An example of a record is "record today 11:00am 2:00pm 'go to school' :SCHOOL"
* You can choose not to add am/pm to the time, but it is reccomened that you add it because theres a possiblity that when the priority command counts up the time in each table, it could miscount if there is no am/pm in the record.
* Must have a colon (:) in front of a tag, and the tag must be in all upercase letters or tag wont work.
* You can make the date today or you can provide a date in the correct format (yyyy/mm/dd)
* Make sure to enclose your desciption in  single quotes.
