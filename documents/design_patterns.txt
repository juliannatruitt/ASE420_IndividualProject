Design Patters:
	*Strategy Pattern:
		- I implemented the stratgey pattern to decide which command should be processed based on the users input. It will use the context class to decide if it 
		is a query, record, report, or priority command and delegade the work to the factory pattern class with the execute method.
		
	*Factory Pattern:
		- The strategy pattern will execute one of the Factory Classes (report, record, query, or priority) and the Facrtory will pass the work to one of the specified
		validation checks. The factory patten helps seperate concerns and it works with the strategy pattern to create cleaner code.
		
	*Singleton:
		- I implemented the singleton design pattern to make sure there is only one database being used. This is to avoid many databases being created and allows 
		only one instance of the database.
